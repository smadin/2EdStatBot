This is 2EdStatBot v1.0. Based (loosely) on Metaphor-A-Minute (https://github.com/dariusk/metaphor-a-minute).

You must supply your own Twitter access token, access token secret, consumer key, and consumer key secret (see https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new).

Requires Twit and Express.

TODO list:
* improve logic for class recommendations
* respond to @-mentions (e.g. "@2EdStatBot roll me a fighter")
* probably clean up the code
